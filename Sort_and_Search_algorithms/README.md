# Sort & Search Algorithms:
  ### Sorting and searching are two fundamental types of algorithms that every programmer should know.
  
# Brute_Force_Search:

### When to use Brute_Force_Search function:
  * When the problem is simple
  * When simplicity is more important than speed.
  * To benchmark other search engines (will be like a baseline!!!)

***The main Idea behind Brute_Force_Search*** is basically we're comparing the query_item against all items one by one in a list till we find the query_item.
The result will be True or False
