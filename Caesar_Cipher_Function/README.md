## Intro and History

A cipher is defined in the Cambridge Dictionary as 'a system of writing that prevents most people from understanding the message'. A cipher is basically a method of transforming a message to conceal its meaning.

All ciphers involve either rearrangement or substitution, or both: the former just takes the initial symbols and puts them in a different order, and the latter substitutes those symbols for others without changing the order of the initial symbols. Regardless of the system, the changes are (in theory) understood only by the sender and the receiver of the message. The first cipher device was used by the ancient Greeks around 400BC to facilitate military communication.

The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who also used it for military purposes. The Roman historian Suetonius writes: "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others." - Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar 56 .

Essentially, what the Caesar Cipher does is take a message, comprising a sequence of characters, and a shift, comprising a number, and shifts each of those characters forward by that number. For example:

So in this example, each character in the initial message is shifted by 2 characters. Notice that the initial message is already encoded: multiple ciphers can be used in series to make a larger, more powerful cipher!
